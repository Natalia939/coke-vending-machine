# 🥤 Coke Vending Machine Simulator

A simple Python program that simulates a vending machine where users insert coins until they’ve paid the full cost of a Coke (50 cents).  

This project is a fun example of using **loops**, **conditional logic**, and **input validation** in Python — originally inspired by Harvard’s CS50 problem set.
